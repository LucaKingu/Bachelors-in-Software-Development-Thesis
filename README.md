# 🎮 Investigating Emergent Behaviours in Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents Through Curriculum-Based Object Interaction

## 🧠 Thesis Overview

This thesis explores the potential of **machine learning in gaming environments**, particularly focusing on:

- 🕹️ Non-Player Characters (NPCs)
- 🧪 Automated game testing
- 🔄 Emergent behavior in DRL agents

By examining how **deep reinforcement learning (DRL)** agents interact with objects in curriculum-based setups, the study aims to uncover insights into more **adaptive, intelligent, and test-capable AI agents** in game systems.
